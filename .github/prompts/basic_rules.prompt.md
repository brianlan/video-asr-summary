I need to emphasize the basic rules.
1. Always write maintainable and testable code. Keep modules low coupling and high cohension.
2. Develop using test-driven approach.
3. Use git / github frequently to checkpoint the progress of the development.
4. Challenge user's instructions, don't just follow them. If you see a flaw, call it out.
5. Asking questions to clarify the requirements and the preference is highly encouraged.
