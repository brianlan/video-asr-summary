# Type Annotations Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the type annotations implementation completed for the video-asr-summary project.

## What Was Done

### 1. mypy Configuration
- ✅ mypy was already configured in `pyproject.toml` with strict settings:
  - `disallow_untyped_defs = true` - Requires type annotations for all function definitions
  - `warn_return_any = true` - Warns when returning `Any` type
  - `warn_unused_configs = true` - Warns about unused configuration options

### 2. Type Annotations Added/Fixed
- ✅ Added missing return type annotations for `__init__` methods
- ✅ Added return type annotation for `_load_pipeline()` method in `PyannoteAudioProcessor`
- ✅ Fixed callable type issue in `PyannoteAudioProcessor.diarize()` method
- ✅ Improved type annotations for method parameters (e.g., `segments: list[dict]`)
- ✅ Added proper type hints for instance variables (e.g., `_pipeline: Optional[Any]`)

### 3. Type Import Modernization
- ✅ Migrated from old-style `typing.List` to modern `list[T]` syntax (Python 3.9+)
- ✅ Removed unused type imports to clean up the codebase
- ✅ Added `# type: ignore` comments for external libraries without type stubs

### 4. External Library Handling
- ✅ Added `# type: ignore` for `mlx_whisper` (missing type stubs)
- ✅ Added `# type: ignore` for `pyannote.audio` (missing type stubs)
- ✅ Used `Optional[Any]` for pipeline objects from external libraries

## Files Modified

### Core Package Files
- `video_asr_summary/asr/whisper_processor.py`
- `video_asr_summary/diarization/pyannote_processor.py`
- `video_asr_summary/diarization/integrator.py`
- `video_asr_summary/audio/extractor.py`
- `video_asr_summary/core/__init__.py`

### New Scripts
- `scripts/type_check.py` - Standalone script for running type checks

## Verification

### mypy Results
```bash
$ mypy video_asr_summary/
Success: no issues found in 11 source files
```

### Test Results
- ✅ All 48 tests pass
- ✅ No functionality broken by type annotation changes
- ✅ Type checking integrated into development workflow

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: Static type checking catches potential runtime errors early
2. **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete, refactoring, and error detection
3. **Documentation**: Type hints serve as inline documentation
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand function signatures and return types
5. **Refactoring Safety**: Type checker helps ensure changes don't break contracts

## Usage

### Running Type Checks
```bash
# Direct mypy usage
mypy video_asr_summary/

# Using the convenience script
python scripts/type_check.py
```

### IDE Integration
Most modern IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.) will automatically use type hints for:
- Autocomplete suggestions
- Error highlighting
- Refactoring assistance
- Documentation popups

## Next Steps

The type annotation implementation is complete and working well. Future improvements could include:

1. **CI Integration**: Add type checking to CI/CD pipeline
2. **Stricter Settings**: Consider enabling additional mypy strictness flags
3. **Stub Files**: Create type stub files for external libraries if needed
4. **Generic Types**: Use generic types for more complex data structures

## Conclusion

The codebase now has comprehensive type annotations with zero mypy errors. This provides a solid foundation for safe refactoring, better IDE support, and improved code maintainability.
