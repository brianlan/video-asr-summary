I'm going to implement a video processing pipeline which includes several steps.
Before we get our hands dirty, I need to emphasize the basic rules.
1. Always write maintainable and testable code. Keep modules low coupling and high cohension.
2. Develop using test-driven approach.
3. Review and reflect on the codebase and do refactoring regularly. 
4. Implement or enhance features one by one. Don't make too big steps.
5. Use git / github frequently to checkpoint the progress of the development.
6. Asking questions to clarify the requirements and the preference is highly encouraged.
