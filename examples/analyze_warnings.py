# Suppress PyTorch/TorchAudio UserWarnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=UserWarning, module='.*torchaudio.*')
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=UserWarning, module='.*pyannote.*')

# Redirect libmpg123 stderr (more complex, requires subprocess control)
# Note: This would need to be done at the process level
```

However, we recommend KEEPING warnings visible during development for debugging.
